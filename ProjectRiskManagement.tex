\section{Concluding Remarks}
Risk management processes have evolved hugely in recent years.
Best practice approaches are increasingly harnessing the concepts of opportunity efficiency and clarity efficiency rather than rigid, linear, event-centric methodologies of the past \citep{association2012}.
However, the PUMP approach remains a forerunner to best practice in the focus on opportunity, an encompassing perspective of uncertainty and in the attention to tackling underlying complexity and assumptions.
This is achieved while increasing the clarity efficiency of the overall process.
Personally, I have discovered and understood concepts that have shifted my perspective from a risk event focus to a holistic appreciation of uncertainty, fundamentally altering my approach to future projects and enriching my career as an engineer.
