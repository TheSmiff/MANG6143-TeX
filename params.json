The Performance Uncertainty Management Processes (PUMP) approach was developed through the assimilation of other industrial risk processes, building upon the best practice approaches from project management bodies. The process was developed by Acres International Management Services for BP and \ffirst implemented on the Magnus o\u000Bffshore North Sea project in 1976. Chapman (1979) published the process as SCERT (Synergistic Contingency Evaluation and Review Technique) and the technique has since been used in a variety of high profi\fle projects for BP, National Power and the Highways Agency. The process has been re\ffined and\r\nassimilated into a complete framework suitable for a variety of clarity requirements. The approach is outlined below. In the report, the PUMP process is explored to identify optimum approaches to project risk management.\r\n\r\n![The PUMP process overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2952791/4516549/4968f6c8-4bfd-11e4-9bb4-fb16870e048b.png)\r\n\r\n###Presentation\r\nFind the report here: [Report.pdf](https://github.com/TheSmiff/MANG6143-TeX/blob/master/ProjectRiskManagement.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nFor further information: [Thomas J Smith](mailto:tsmiff@live.co.uk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
